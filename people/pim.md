blurb: Pim is the McCosker Chair of Aquatic Biology and Curator of Invertebrate Zoology at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. He is also an Associate Editor for the journal "Molecular Ecology". He studies the biodiversity and evolution of tropical reef corals, from close to the surface to well into the mesophotic zone. As a molecular ecologist, he combines genomics and field ecology to understand how corals diversify and adapt to different and changing environmental conditions. Prior to his appointment at the Academy, he was an ARC DECRA Research Fellow at the Global Change Institute (The University of Queensland), and lead scientist for the Deep Reef component of the "XL Catlin Seaview Survey".
