    I am a Postdoctoral Researcher working on coral reef ecology based at the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands), and associated with the CARMABI Research Institute and the California Academy of Sciences. I am involved in the CoralScape project with the Reefscape Genomics Lab, and have been working on a landscape genomics analysis of an abundant coral-eroding sponge. I am particularly interested in how populations of such aggressively spreading sponges expand in space and time. In my current position, I focus on the symbiosis between coral reef sponges and photosynthetic microorganisms in Cura√ßao (Southern Caribbean), where most of my fieldwork takes place. In my free time, I travel with or through books.

    I am a marine ecologist associated with The University of Queensland, the CARMABI Research Station and the Reefscape Genomics Lab. My work focuses on the interaction between symbiotic corals and their physical environment. Particularly, I am seeking to get a better understanding of how corals are adapted to the environmental conditions they live under, and how they react to changes in their environment. In the current project with the Reefscape Genomics Lab I am exploring how plate-shaped corals growing on the deeper reef slopes interact with sinking sediments that deposit on their surface, and how they assimilate nutrients from these particles. When I am not working, I love being outdoors; I am never happier than when windsurfing, fishing, hiking, or exploring new places.
