    I am the McCosker Chair of Aquatic Biology and a Curator of Invertebrate Zoology at the California Academy of Sciences, and lead the Reefscape Genomics Lab. As a molecular ecologist, I combine genomics and field ecology to understand how corals diversify and adapt to different and changing environmental conditions. I have a particular interest in mesophotic coral ecosystems, and developing novel technologies to enhance the study of coral reef ecosystems. I am also an Associate Editor for the journal "Molecular Ecology", an Associate Professor at San Fransisco State University, and an Associate Scientist at the CARMABI Research Institute. Prior to my appointment at the Academy, I was an ARC DECRA Research Fellow at the Global Change Institute (The University of Queensland), and lead scientist for the Deep Reef component of the "XL Catlin Seaview Survey".

    Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, exploring the local (marine) outdoors, keeping aquaria, playing guitar, listening to 90s hardcore bands, and DIY electronics.

    I am a senior at UC Berkeley studying environmental sciences, deeply intrigued by marine biology. Amid unfettered anthropogenic activities, I am interested in understanding how organisms respond both physiologically and genetically to environmental perturbations. Working in the Reefscape Genomics Lab, I hope to fully immerse myself in the field of coral genomics and learn about coral resilience to global change.
    At school, I conduct research on elephant seals in the Vázquez-Medina Lab to assess the effects of warming on their thermoregulatory capacity and ability to compensate behaviorally. In applying this knowledge to corals, I hope to understand how these organisms cope with multiple stressors and whether there are synergistic effects.
    In my free time, I work as a journalist seeking to reveal the misfortunes of climate change. I also love to cook, bike, and frolic through nature.

    I am a marine ecologist interested in the ecological and evolutionary processes that determine the distribution and survival of tropical corals. My research focuses on the interactions between corals, coral-associated microbes, and the environment, and the role of each of these components in coral's health along the depth gradient. As a postdoctoral research fellow at the Reefscape Genomics Lab, I lead the *Helioseris* project aiming to identify the causes of the rapid decline of the Caribbean endemic Sunray Lettuce coral (Helioseris cucullata) by combining closed-circuit rebreather diving, 3D imagenary, and genomics.
    
    I enjoy running, hiking, dancing, and playing board games in my free time.

    I am a PhD student at the University of Auckland, working in the Reefscape Genomics lab. My research focuses on monospecific stands—areas of the reef dominated by a single coral species—specifically targeting common and dominant corals. I aim to describe the genetic diversity within these monospecific stands, investigate the influence of reef complexity on their formation, and analyze how these stands change over time. I utilize large-area photogrammetry to gain a better understanding of genomic and spatial distribution patterns, as well as the interactions between reef complexity and community structure.

    I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Reefscape Genomics Lab at the California Academy of Sciences. I am using population genomics and 3D imagery to understand hybridization and adaptation across reef depth in a Caribbean coral community. More broadly, my research focuses on how microevolutionary forces shape patterns of genetic diversity across space and through time, and how the processes inferred from past and current genomic patterns might influence evolutionary potential in a changing world. I am also passionate about science communication and I'm excited to be able to explore and teach about our natural world at the Cal Academy.
    
    In my free time, I enjoy climbing, backpacking, gardening, baking, and trying out new restaurants and recipes.
