    I am the McCosker Chair of Aquatic Biology and a Curator of Invertebrate Zoology at the California Academy of Sciences, and lead the Reefscape Genomics Lab. As a molecular ecologist, I combine genomics and field ecology to understand how corals diversify and adapt to different and changing environmental conditions. I have a particular interest in mesophotic coral ecosystems, and developing novel technologies to enhance the study of coral reef ecosystems. I am also an Associate Editor for the journal "Molecular Ecology", an Associate Professor at San Fransisco State University, and an Associate Scientist at the CARMABI Research Institute. Prior to my appointment at the Academy, I was an ARC DECRA Research Fellow at the Global Change Institute (The University of Queensland), and lead scientist for the Deep Reef component of the "XL Catlin Seaview Survey".

    Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, exploring the local (marine) outdoors, keeping aquaria, playing guitar, listening to 90s hardcore bands, and DIY electronics.
