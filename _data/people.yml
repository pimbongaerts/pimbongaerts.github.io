    I am the McCosker Chair of Aquatic Biology and a Curator of Invertebrate Zoology at the California Academy of Sciences, and lead the Reefscape Genomics Lab. As a molecular ecologist, I combine genomics and field ecology to understand how corals diversify and adapt to different and changing environmental conditions. I have a particular interest in mesophotic coral ecosystems, and developing novel technologies to enhance the study of coral reef ecosystems. I am also an Associate Editor for the journal "Molecular Ecology", an Associate Professor at San Fransisco State University, and an Associate Scientist at the CARMABI Research Institute. Prior to my appointment at the Academy, I was an ARC DECRA Research Fellow at the Global Change Institute (The University of Queensland), and lead scientist for the Deep Reef component of the "XL Catlin Seaview Survey".

    Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, exploring the local (marine) outdoors, keeping aquaria, playing guitar, listening to 90s hardcore bands, and DIY electronics.

    I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Reefscape Genomics Lab at the California Academy of Sciences. I am using population genomics and 3D imagery to understand hybridization and adaptation across reef depth in a Caribbean coral community. More broadly, my research focuses on how microevolutionary forces shape patterns of genetic diversity across space and through time, and how the processes inferred from past and current genomic patterns might influence evolutionary potential in a changing world. I am also passionate about science communication and I'm excited to be able to explore and teach about our natural world at the Cal Academy.
    
    In my free time, I enjoy climbing, backpacking, gardening, baking, and trying out new restaurants and recipes.

    I am a Masters student at the University of Groningen currently doing a research project with the Reefscape Genomics group. My main interests lie in population genetics, and how to use genetic data to get a better understanding of current and historic geographical events. I have recently started to get into the field of reefscape genomics and coral reefs in general and I am excited to learn more. I am also starting to get into data science and coding and enjoy learning to work with new softwares. In my free time I practice surfing, climbing and most outdoor sports. If I'm not able to be outside I like to make music using various instruments and software.

    I am a PhD student under the supervision of Cynthia Riginos at the University of Queensland and Pim Bongaerts in the Reefscape Genomics Lab at California Academy of Sciences. My PhD focuses on a locally dominant and abundant scleractinian genus *Agaricia* in the Southern Caribbean. Species of *Agaricia* are distributed across the entire depth range zooxanthellate corals can live at, thus including both shallow and mesophotic coral ecosystems. I use 3D visualiations from photogrammetry and reduced representation sequencing techniques to study spatially explicit population genomic patterns occuring over fine-scales. Notably, I am determining the effect microhabitat has on niche differentiation and bleaching response on both named species and morphologically cryptic taxa in *Agaricia*.
    
    I am also employed at the University of Queensland as a Senior Research Technician where I coordinate SCUBA diving field trips and genomics lab work and I work casually as a Carpentries Programming Instructor at the Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation.
    
    I aspire to do a Post Doc and I have been very lucky in my PhD to have gained experience in many research areas including field, lab and computing. In my spare time, I enjoy admiring and fussing over my growing tropcial plant collection, hula hooping and reading or listening to philosophy!
